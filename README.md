# DataAnalysis-Projects
This repository contains a wide range of projects that are required to enhance data analytics skills. Beginning with the capture of raw data, data cleaning, data exploration, data analytics, and evaluation, numerous techniques are used to create the visualization.

## Introduction to Data Analysis:
Anaconda: An open-source distribution of Python and R for data research termed Anaconda seeks to make package management and deployment easier.

Jupyter Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.

Numpy for 1D and 2D data

Pandas Series and Dataframes

DataAnalysis Process
# 1. DataScientist Salary EDA
In this project, I select a salary dataset for data scientists and use NumPy and pandas to analyze it. I finish the entire data analysis procedure, from asking a query to spreading the results.
# 2. CO2 Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning Models
Experimenting with various regression, K-means Clustering models try to arrive at the most accurate prediction of the fuel consumption and CO2 emission of cars.

On Jupyter notebooks, analysis is performed using the Python Scikit-learn module. Using residual MSE, mean absolute error, R-squared value, and explained variance, the accuracy of each model is evaluated.
# 3. Heart Disease Analysis
A variety of heart-related disorders are referred to as heart diseases. Blood vessel illnesses, like coronary artery disease, and heart rhythm issues are included under the general term "heart disease."Â  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease". Narrowed or obstructed blood arteries are the hallmark of illnesses known as cardiovascular disease, which can cause a heart attack, chest discomfort, or stroke. A healthy lifestyle can prevent or treat any sort of heart disease.

# Objectives
Using the dataset provided for heart analysis, we must analyze the risk of a heart attack based on a variety of features, and the prediction from the analysis will indicate whether or not a person is susceptible to heart attacks.

The detailed analysis can proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA).
