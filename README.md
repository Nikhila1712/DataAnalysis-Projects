# DataAnalysis-Projects
This repository contains a wide range of projects that are required to enhance data analytics skills. Beginning with the capture of raw data, data cleaning, data exploration, data analytics, and evaluation, numerous techniques are used to create the visualization.

## Introduction to Data Analysis:
Anaconda: An open-source distribution of Python and R for data research termed Anaconda seeks to make package management and deployment easier.

Jupyter Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.

Numpy for 1D and 2D data

Pandas Series and Dataframes

DataAnalysis Process
# 1. DataScientist Salary EDA
In this project, I select a salary dataset for data scientists and use NumPy and pandas to analyze it. I finish the entire data analysis procedure, from asking a query to spreading the results.
# 2. CO2 Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning Models
Experimenting with various regression, K-means Clustering models try to arrive at the most accurate prediction of the fuel consumption and CO2 emission of cars.

On Jupyter notebooks, analysis is performed using the Python Scikit-learn module. Using residual MSE, mean absolute error, R-squared value, and explained variance, the accuracy of each model is evaluated.
